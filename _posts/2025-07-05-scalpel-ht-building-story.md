## Why Scalpel HT?

[Scalpel HT][scalpel-ht] is a member of Cannondail's mountain bike family that
targets XC races and marathones. There is also [a brother][scalpel] called just
"Scalpel" that features rear suspension. Both are popular modern XC bikes worth
choosing even for top world XC events.

Why Cannondale and Scalpel HT? At the time when I started the project I was not
a cycling expert and was not aware of all these world XC championships and all
the top brands like BMC, Canyon, Specialized, Trek, SCOTT, Cannondale, etc.. It
were times when I was chasing Bachelor's degree in engineering in Poland. When
you are an abroad student living in a dormitory - you have really not much
freedom in such expensive and technologically-complicated projects. Just check
out my room while building the bike:

These times I was praying nobody from dormitory administration would come and
see what a hell was going on in my room.

So, the focus during building was not on what I wanted, but on what I needed
(well... mostly). What did I need then? The things I considered when choosing
the components:

* One time investement.
* Service intervals and service complexity, that defines how much time per, for
  example, month I will needed to invest into servising (cleaning, replacing,
  adjusting, etc.).
* Components durability and components costs, that defines how much money I
  will invest into the bike per, for example, month (like chain change, etc.).

If the goal was to only minimise things listed above, then it would be better
not to buy a bike at all. So there were also a few things that I had to adjust
to the costs:

* Perfomance on track (weight, gears, tyres, etc.).
* Comfort on longer rides (the longest rides for me are around 100 kilometers).

These of course are general definitions, I will cover them in details in the
following chapters.

Getting back to [Scalpel HT](scalpel-ht) vs [Scalpel](scalpel). That happens,
that two the most difficult and expensive things to service in every bike
(espesially the expensive ones) are shocks and bearings. What two things that
full suspension bikes do have and hardtails do not? Right, the rear shock and
suspension links that use bearings. These two components drastically increase
all the things I wanted to minimize: the costs and the time needed for
servicing.

On the other hand rear suspension comes with comfort on longer unpaved rides and
a better rear stability on technically hard elements. But you know what?
Sometimes I deserve these kicks in my ass when I oversleep some bumps on the
trail. On the technically camplex trails with no rear suspension I really had to
get through all these hard downhill and uphill sections on my own legs learning
how to handle and how to choose the best way trough hell.

Why Cannondale and not any other brand? The answer is simple - these times
Cannondale had chippest framesets in Poland.

So, enogh of the teory, and lets get to the real tech and the building fun.
