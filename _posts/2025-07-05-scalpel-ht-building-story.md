## Why Scalpel HT?

[Scalpel HT][scalpel-ht] is a member of Cannondail's mountain bike family that
targets XC races and marathones. There is also [a brother][scalpel] called just
"Scalpel" that features rear suspension. Both are popular modern XC bikes worth
choosing even for top world XC events.

Why Cannondale and Scalpel HT? At the time when I started the project I was not
a cycling expert and was not aware of all these world XC championships and all
the top brands like BMC, Canyon, Specialized, Trek, SCOTT, etc.. It was times
when I was chasing Bachelor's degree in engineering in Poland. When you are an
abroad student living in a dormitory - you have really not much freedom in such
expensive and technologically-complicated projects. Just check out my room while
building the bike:

These times I was praying nobody from dormitory administration would come and
see what was going on in my room.

So, the focus during building was not on what I wanted, but on what I needed
(well... mostly). What did I need then? The things I considered:

* One time investement.
* Service intervals and service complexity, that defines how much time per, for
  example, month is needed to invest into servising (cleaning, replaing,
  adjusting, etc.).
* Components durability versus components costs, that defines how much money I
  will invest into the bike per, for example, month (like chain chain, etc.).

If the goal was to only minimise things liste above, then it would be better not
to buy a bike at all. So there were also a few things that I had to adjust to
the costs:

* Perfomance on track (weight, gears, etc.).
* Comfort on longer rides.

These of course are general definitions, I will cover them in details in the
following chapters.

Getting back to [Scalpel HT](scalpel-ht) vs [Scalpel](scalpel). That happens,
that two the most difficult and expensive things to service in every bike
(espesially the expensive ones) are shocks and bearings. What two things that
full suspension bikes do have and hardtails do not? Right, the rear shock and
suspension links that use bearings. These two components drastically increase
all the things I wanted to minimize: the costs and the time.

Why Cannondale and not any other brand? The answer is simple - these times
Cannondale had chippest framesets in Poland.

So, enoght of the teory, and lets get to real number and the building fun.
