Hello there! Some time ago I was chasing Bachelor's degree in the Gdańsk
University of Technology. And as a thesis I choose my own topic: "Methods for
implementing control algorithms using embedded systems.". Sounds vague, isn't
it? But this was my first dive into low level programming, and I want to share
some of my thoughts and findings. Though the topic is a bit complicated, I will
try to be as simple as possible and use some of the existing technologies out
there like, for example, FreeRTOS and QEMU.
